# LaunchkeyMK3-FLStudio

### How to install: 
* Put the downloaded folder into Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Hardware
* In FL Studio's MIDI Settings, assign LKMK3 MIDI to Launchkey 49 MK3 (user) and MIDIIN2 (LKMK3 MIDI) to Launchkey 49 MK3 Midi (user)
* Assign the port 1 to LKMK3 MIDI on both the input and the output, and the port 2 to MIDIIN2 (LKMK3 MIDI) on both the input and the output as well. You can also assign them any other port, as long as they're different for LKM3 MIDI and MIDIIN2 (LKMK3 MIDI).
* Enjoy!
